//
// Everything the AegisSOC console renders is bundled into one `Dataset` object,
// so the same pages can be driven either by the built-in demo (spec-derived
// sample data) or by a dataset produced from a user's own logs (see
// `lib/ingest`). Base record types are reused from `lib/soc-data` — this module
// only adds the container type, thin accessors, an empty baseline, and the
// assembled `demoDataset`.
